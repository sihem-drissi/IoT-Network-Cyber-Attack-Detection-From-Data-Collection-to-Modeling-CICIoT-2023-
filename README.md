#IoT Network Cyber Attack Detection: From Data Collection to Modeling (CICIoT 2023)


This project focuses on detecting cyber attacks in IoT networks using machine learning techniques, with an emphasis on data preprocessing. The dataset used is the CICIoT 2023 dataset, which contains IoT network traffic data, including both normal and attack traffic. The primary goal is to preprocess the data effectively, followed by the development of a machine learning model for cyber attack detection.
